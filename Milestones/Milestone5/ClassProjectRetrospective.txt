Class Project Retrospective

1. Conduct a Safety Check

Everyone feels safe. There isn't the feel to filter any ideas or comments. 
We're all really open with our thoughts and feel that everyone values our 
comments. We all feel like we are a four on the Safety Gradiant Table.

2. What did you learn from the Sprint?

Mattherin feels that pulling often from the repository is very important.

Ryan thinks that we need to overestimate more for our tasks. He feels that
when we actually started on the tasks that they felt larger than we expected
them to be. Also, remembering to create a new branch for our work. We all
at time forgot to do that.

Nikolas seconds the pulling. He also stressed the importance of getting into
a rhythm in order to not mess things up. 

Zhendong was the one who tried to fix the site when it went down. He says 
that two unrelated things/separate projects cannot be merged together, at
least not without changing some settings if that's even possible. 

3. What still puzzles you?

We all feel that there's an element of unknown with Git. We feel uneasy
doing pulls. We hope that we don't break things. 

Figuring out the quirks of VSTS. 

4. What can the team do better next Sprint? Make a specific action plan.

Finding more time in the middle of the week to meet up is something
we need to start doing. We've been meeting up on the weekends, 
specifically on Sunday. That's too late. We'll better plan, but it's
hard with our different schedules. 

5. Are there any itmes that need to be brought up with someone outside the
team?

Ryan wants to know how Dr. Morse is going to grade mid-Sprint.
