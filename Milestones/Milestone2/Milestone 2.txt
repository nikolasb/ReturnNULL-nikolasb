Milestone 2
Task 1

-- All primary needs and features.

* Text input.
* A main page from which viewers can see a list of articles.
* Being able to click on an article title from the main page takes the user to a
	different page that has just the article. We don't want the entirety of all
	articles being posted on the main page. Probably just the titles.
* Perhaps a comment section for each article.
* We want to offer tags that people can apply to their articles so that they
	can be categorized.
* We also want people to be able to search for articles based on title and
	tags.
* We want people to be able to filter search results according to relevancy and
	time.

-- A list of requirements, including non-functional requirements.

* Probably a minimum word length for articles so people can't spam a bunch of mini articles.
* Maybe some sort of word checker to see if a person actually typed words. We don't want
	"articles"  composed of nothing but "asdfasd asjdfasd asdjhfakd."
* Some sort of account system. Logged-in users may create articles and comments.
* Some algorithm to be used when users search for articles based on relevancy.
	What defines relevancy?
* Ability to remove articles as we see fit. Maybe someone found a way around the system
	that checks to make sure people aren't just filling articles with gibberish.
