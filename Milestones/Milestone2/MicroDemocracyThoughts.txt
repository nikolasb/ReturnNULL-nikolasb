- Allow representatives to ask questions and poll their constituents in real time. Representative questions are sent immediately to phones get a quick immediate opinions.

- History of bills. Voters want to easily see the history of a bill. When was it drafted? What changes were made by who and when? Who voted for or against the bill? 

- Quick human readable summaries of bills / laws. 

- Compilation of many varying opinions from different sources for and against 

- History of representatives. Where did they work? Who gave them money? What did they vote for or against? 

- In app voting system. Every members gets 100 votes to allocate across any issue. The member can give their votes to a representative, which then representative can then vote on. Any number of votes can be given for or against any issue. 
(Can votes be moved? If so how many times? How long must they stay allocated to a certain issue?)
