Our web application, Each Voice, is designed to help bring together information
on local and state government matters to help the public more efficiently
acquire this information to better understand and vote in these matters.
Our goal is that in being able to locate this information easily the American people
will participate more in local and state matters. Each Voice will include details on
proposed local bill, laws, and representatives. The public will be able to discuss
these proposed laws and bill with others. This combination of information
aggregation and user discussion is something that does not
currently exist. We hope to provide a place where the public can start to
become more active in and better educated about their local
and state governments.
