Arrticle Fibs is a website for people who want to test out their creative writing skills by posting fake new articles. 
Once published, the website will provide an official looking format for the text the users entered (headers, body, etc.).
The website will present the articles in a fashion that gives off the impression that it is a real and reliable 
news website. Unlike other websites that mix in fake news articles with real ones, this website will be dedicated 
to the creative work of users.
