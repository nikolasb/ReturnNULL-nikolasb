Our web application, MicroDem, is designed to help bring together information 
on local and state government matters to help the public more efficiently
aquire this information to better understand and vote in these matters.
We are providing a way for voters to easily access and educate themselves on
very current topics. This includes proposed local bill, laws, and 
representatives. Voters will be able to provide input on these topics.
This combination of information agrigation and voter influence does not
currently exist. We hope to provide a place where voters can start to 
become more active in and better educated about their local government.
